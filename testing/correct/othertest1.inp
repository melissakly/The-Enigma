SHALL I compare thee to a summers day
Thou art more LOVELY and more temperate

Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May

And summers lease hath all too short a date

Sometime too
hot the eye of heaven shines
And  often IS his gold COMPLEXION dimmed
And every fair from fair sometime declines
By chance or natures changing course untrimmed
But thy eternal summer shall not fade
