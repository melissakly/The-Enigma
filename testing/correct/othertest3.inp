* B BETA I II III AAAA
I dont want another pretty face
I dont want just anyone to hold
I dont want my love to go to waste
I want you and your BEAUTIFULLLL soul
I know that you are something special

To you Id be always faithful

I want to be what you always needed
Then I hope youll see the heart in me
I
